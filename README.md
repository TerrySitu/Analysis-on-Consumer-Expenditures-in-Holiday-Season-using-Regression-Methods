# Analysis-on-Consumer-Expenditures-in-Holiday-Season-using-Regression-Methods
It is easy to understand the more money a household earns, the higher there expenditure will be. Beyond that, there are certainly other factors that would impact a family’s overall level of expenditure. We investigated the relationship of household total expenditure with various predictors such as: age, income levels, regions, housing status, education background, marital status, vehicles owned and etc. Our dataset is from Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey, which is run by the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau. The CE is essential since it is the only Federal survey that provides data on a complete range of information for consumer expenditure’s and income, as well as other related consumer characteristics.
